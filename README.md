This Capstone required an application be made to view a ledger that included date,time,deposit,description, and vendor. It prompts the user for their information and displays different screens. This code is beginner friendly.
An interesting piece of this code is the readtransactionsFile method on lines 99-122 because it can be changed to perfect the code and the error handling syntax was useful.
